# Optimizing Employee Turnover Prediction Through HR Data Cleansing and Feature Engineering

**Overview:**

This project focuses on improving the accuracy of employee turnover prediction models by meticulously cleaning and preparing messy HR datasets.  The analysis involves handling missing values, identifying and correcting inconsistencies, and engineering new features to enhance the predictive power of machine learning algorithms.  The goal is to provide HR departments with cleaner, more informative data for building robust predictive models and implementing proactive employee retention strategies.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (optional, depending on the chosen prediction model)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key statistics and summaries of the data cleaning process to the console.  This includes information about missing values handled, data transformations applied, and newly engineered features.  Additionally, the script may generate visualization files (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) illustrating data distributions and relationships.  These plots will be saved in the `./output` directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist).  The specific output will depend on the implemented data cleaning and visualization steps.  Example output files might include: `missing_values_summary.txt`, `feature_correlation.png`, etc.


**Directory Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the raw HR dataset(s).
* `src/`: Contains the Python scripts for data cleaning and preparation.
* `output/`: Contains the output files (plots, summary statistics).
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
* `main.py`: The main script to run the data cleaning and preparation pipeline.
